// All live under the `lean` parent, with no top-level aliases: `adg lean new`
// (author), `adg lean brief` (compile the brief / PreToolUse hook), `adg lean
// index` (validate + generate the README), `adg lean verify` (Stop-hook re-check),
// `adg lean check` (executable grep assertions), and `adg lean review` (emit a
// review packet for a reviewer to judge against the rubric).
