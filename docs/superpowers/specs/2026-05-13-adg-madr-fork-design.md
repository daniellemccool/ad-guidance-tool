**Date:** 2026-05-13
**Status:** Draft for review
**Scope:** Fork `github.com/adr/ad-guidance-tool` to `github.com/daniellemccool/ad-guidance-tool`. Convert the file format from ADG's HTML-anchor-based layout to MADR 4.0–native markdown. Fold the originally-planned §A (data integrity) and §B (workflow ergonomics) bug fixes into this refactor.

## Goal

Make ADG a MADR 4.0–native CLI that uses the *minimal + Decision Drivers* template by default, retains ADG's useful extensions (tags, custom links, comments) as YAML frontmatter, and ships a clean one-shot migration from today's anchor-based format.

## Principles

1. **Markdown-first.** A decision record renders correctly on any markdown viewer with no tooling. No HTML anchors, no proprietary body syntax.
2. **Convention over configuration.** Canonical MADR section names are fixed. The current `set-config` flags for section headers are removed.
3. **Just enough structure.** Required: H1 title, Context and Problem Statement, Considered Options, Decision Outcome. Everything else optional.
4. **Filename is identity.** `NNNN-slug.md` (no `AD` prefix). No `adr_id` frontmatter.
5. **History in git.** No in-tool changelog. Comments are the one structured exception — they capture time-stamped commentary that wouldn't naturally land in commit messages.

## Preserve / Drop / Add

**Preserve:** model concept (directory of ADRs), CLI verb surface, Clean Architecture layout, Cobra, mockery, Go build.

**Drop:**
- All HTML anchors (`<a name="question">`, `<a name="option-N">`, `<a name="comment-N">`).
- `AD` filename prefix.
- `set-config` for section headers.
- `links.precedes` / `links.succeeds` (generic precedes/succeeds not in MADR).
- Numbered option references (`We decided for [option-1](#option-1)` → `Chosen option: "Title"`).
- Status values `open` / `decided` (replaced by MADR vocabulary).
- `decide --force` auto-creating an option.

**Add:**
- MADR frontmatter fields: `date`, `decision-makers`, `consulted`, `informed`.
- ADG extensions (preserved): `tags`, `links` (custom only), `comments` (text as source of truth).
- `adg migrate` command.
- `adg supersede` command (first-class).
- `adg edit --from-stdin` / `--from-file` with replace semantics.
- `adg validate --quiet` flag.
- Stdout/stderr split across status-only commands.

## File Format & Data Model

### Filename

`NNNN-slug.md`
- `NNNN`: 4-digit zero-padded sequential ID.
- `slug`: lowercase title, spaces/punctuation → single dashes.
- Subdirectories permitted (MADR's "categories via subdirectories" convention).

### Canonical body template (minimal + Decision Drivers)

```markdown
# {short title, representative of solved problem and found solution}

## Context and Problem Statement

{...}

## Decision Drivers

* {driver 1}

## Considered Options

* {option 1}
* {option 2}

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{option title}", because {justification}.

### Consequences

* Good, because {...}
* Bad, because {...}
```

Sections are matched by H2/H3 header text only (canonical MADR names, case-insensitive). No anchors. The parser is tolerant of section ordering and preserves unknown H2 sections verbatim on round-trip.

### Frontmatter schema

YAML, between `---` fences at the top. All MADR-defined fields are optional. ADG extensions are grouped at the bottom.

```yaml
---
# MADR-defined
status: "accepted"              # proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | superseded by ADR-NNNN
date: 2026-05-13                # YYYY-MM-DD; auto-updated on mutating commands
decision-makers:
  - "danielle"
consulted: []
informed: []

# ADG extensions
tags:
  - infrastructure
links:                          # custom non-supersession links
  related-to:
    - "0004"
supersedes:                     # ADG ext: forward pointer set by `adg supersede`
  - "0042"
comments:                       # source of truth for the rendered ## Comments body section
  - author: "danielle"
    date: "2026-05-13 14:22:01"
    text: "First impression — this might not survive next year."
legacy-outcome: false           # ADG ext: set by `adg migrate` for ADRs whose outcome doesn't fit MADR shape; validate skips outcome-shape check when true
---
```

**Status vocabulary** is MADR-canonical. `superseded by ADR-NNNN` is a literal string. `adg supersede` writes this on the old ADR and writes the inverse pointer in `supersedes` on the new ADR.

**Date** is auto-managed: set on creation, updated on `decide`/`edit`/`comment`/`tag`/`link`/`supersede`. User can manually edit. `--no-touch-date` flag on mutating commands suppresses the update.

**RACI fields** are user-managed. Flags exist on `add`/`decide` to set them; ADG never mutates them automatically.

### `index.yaml` — cache only

In the fork, `index.yaml` becomes a *performance cache* for `adg list`, regenerated by `adg rebuild`. ADR files themselves are always authoritative. Every read goes to disk; the index is consulted only when explicitly listing.

**Open question for implementation phase:** keep `index.yaml` as a cache, or drop it entirely. For models with <100 ADRs (the user's case), full scan is fast. Recommendation: drop it; add a `--cache` opt-in if performance ever becomes a complaint. Ratify before PR 1.

### Comments — architectural fix

Storage: frontmatter `comments: [{author, date, text}, ...]` list. The `Comment.Text` field name replaces the legacy `Comment.Comment` stutter; YAML tag is `text`. Comment `date` is a timestamp with time-of-day (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`) to preserve commentary ordering within a single day; the ADR-level `date` frontmatter field is day-precision (`YYYY-MM-DD`) per MADR.

Rendering: every write to an ADR re-renders a trailing `## Comments` H2 from the frontmatter list:

```markdown
## Comments

* **2026-05-13 14:22:01 — @danielle:** First impression — this might not survive next year.
* **2026-05-15 09:12:33 — @rsmith:** Confirmed in prod, see incident #4571.
```

If `comments` is empty/absent, the section is omitted. **The body section is never parsed; it's purely rendered output.** Editing it by hand has no effect — the next write overwrites it.

This makes the §A.1 bug class structurally impossible: there's no destructive body-rewrite cycle.

### Go struct

```go
type Decision struct {
    // Identity (from filename, not stored in frontmatter)
    ID   string
    Slug string

    // Title (from H1, not duplicated in frontmatter)
    Title string

    // MADR frontmatter
    Status         string
    Date           string
    DecisionMakers []string `yaml:"decision-makers"`
    Consulted      []string
    Informed       []string

    // ADG extensions
    Tags           []string
    Links          map[string][]string
    Supersedes     []string
    Comments       []Comment
    LegacyOutcome  bool `yaml:"legacy-outcome,omitempty"`
}

type Comment struct {
    Author string `yaml:"author"`
    Date   string `yaml:"date"`
    Text   string `yaml:"text"`
}
```

Body content is held as opaque `[]byte` for round-tripping. A thin parser (`internal/domain/decision/bodyparser.go`) extracts:

- Options list (bullets under `## Considered Options`).
- Decision Outcome's chosen-option string and rationale.
- Section presence map (for validation).
- Custom/unknown H2 sections (preserved verbatim).

### Section parsing rules

| Header text (case-insensitive) | Canonical name | Required |
|---|---|---|
| Context and Problem Statement | context | yes |
| Decision Drivers | drivers | no |
| Considered Options | options | yes |
| Decision Outcome | outcome | yes |
| Pros and Cons of the Options | pros-cons | no |
| More Information | more | no |
| Comments | comments | ADG-rendered; not parsed |

Any other H2 is preserved as a custom section. On round-trip, known sections sit in canonical MADR order; unknown sections retain their original relative position.

H3 subsections within Decision Outcome (`Consequences`, `Confirmation`) are recognized but treated as opaque body content.

### Round-trip property

```
∀ ADR file f:
  parse(f) → re-render → f'
  diff(f, f') == ∅   (modulo `date` if a mutation occurred)
```

This is the strongest test invariant. Any failure indicates the parser/renderer pair is lossy.

## Command Semantics

### `adg init <model-name>`

Unchanged in shape. Creates the directory, writes an empty `index.yaml` (if kept), writes a `README.md` stub documenting MADR convention.

### `adg add --title "..."` (repeatable)

Writes `0001-slug.md` (no `AD` prefix) using the minimal + Decision Drivers template. ID is the next 4-digit number from a directory scan. New optional flags:

- `--decision-maker <name>` (repeatable) → frontmatter `decision-makers`
- `--consulted <name>` (repeatable)
- `--informed <name>` (repeatable)
- `--status <s>` (default `proposed`)
- `--date YYYY-MM-DD` (default today)

Stdout: `0001\n` per created ADR, one per line in `--title` order. Stderr: readable success messages.

### `adg edit --id <id>` — dual mode

**Append-mode (flag form, MADR-renamed):**
```
adg edit --id 0001 [--context "..."] [--drivers "..."] [--option "..."] [--more "..."]
```

Each flag appends to its section. `--option` is repeatable (appends bullets). `--question`/`--criteria` from old ADG are renamed to `--context`/`--drivers`.

**Replace-mode (new):**
```
adg edit --id 0001 (--from-stdin | --from-file PATH) [--force]
```

Input parsed as markdown body. Sections present in input replace those sections in the ADR; absent sections are untouched.

**Section gate** (input touching these is rejected):
- `## Decision Outcome` → use `adg decide`
- `## Comments` → use `adg comment`

**Status gate** (both modes):

| Status | Default | With `--force` |
|---|---|---|
| `proposed` | allowed | (same) |
| `accepted` | refuse, point at `adg revise` | allowed, stderr warning |
| `deprecated`, `superseded by …` | refuse, point at `adg revise` | allowed, stderr warning |

This is a backwards-compat shift: today's flag-based edit silently rewrites decided ADRs. New behavior refuses unless `--force`.

### `adg decide --id <id> --option <option> [--rationale "..."]`

Rewrites `## Decision Outcome` body to exactly:
```
Chosen option: "{option text}", because {rationale}.
```
(Or omits `because …` if no rationale.)

`--option` matching:
- **Numeric** (`--option 2`): position in the current `## Considered Options` bullet list at call time. Resolves to bullet text and writes that text.
- **Text** (`--option "Use Postgres"`): case-insensitive match against bullet text. Errors on ambiguity.

Sets `status: accepted`, touches `date`, clears `legacy-outcome` flag.

`--force` bypasses two guards:
- Already-accepted ADRs (re-deciding requires `--force`; `adg revise` is the cleaner path).
- Decision Outcome sections with author-written content beyond the canonical placeholder (e.g. a hand-written shutdown order, customized `### Consequences` bullets). The whole `## Decision Outcome` section — including any nested `### Consequences` H3 — is replaced; this is the documented contract.

The option must already exist in Considered Options. MADR principle: decisions are made among previously considered options. If the option isn't in the list, `decide` errors and points at `adg edit` (regardless of `--force`).

### `adg comment --id <id> --author <a> --text "..."`

Append-only. Adds `{author, date: now, text}` to frontmatter `comments`. Re-renders `## Comments` body section from the full list. No body parsing.

§A.1 resolved here architecturally.

### `adg supersede --new <new-id> --old <old-id> [--rationale "..."] [--date YYYY-MM-DD]`

New first-class command. Atomic two-file write:
1. Old ADR: `status: "superseded by ADR-<new-id>"`, date touched.
2. New ADR: appends `<old-id>` to `supersedes` list, date touched.
3. If `--rationale`: appends a comment to the **old** ADR (`Superseded by ADR-<new-id>: {rationale}`).

Refuses if old ADR is already superseded (don't silently overwrite supersession chains). `--force` overrides.

### `adg revise --id <id>`

Creates a copy with title `{original} (Revised)`, status `proposed`, fresh date, empty Decision Outcome and Consequences. Tags, decision-makers, etc. copied. Comments NOT copied. Body sections (Context, Drivers, Options) copied verbatim.

Returns new ID on stdout.

**Stays independent of supersession.** User runs `adg supersede --new X --old Y` separately if they want the relationship recorded.

### `adg link --tag <tag> [--reverse-tag <tag>] <source-id> <target-id>`

Frontmatter `links: {<tag>: [<id>, ...]}`. Bidirectional requires `--reverse-tag`.

`precedes`/`succeeds` hardcoded pair dropped — all links are custom-tagged. Cycle-detection logic removed (it was tied to `precedes` specifically).

Refuses `supersedes`/`superseded-by` tag names — points at `adg supersede`.

### `adg tag --id <id> <tag>`

Unchanged. Frontmatter `tags` array. Refuses duplicates.

### `adg list [--tag t] [--status s] [--id range] [--title regex] [--supersedes id] [--format ids]`

Renders from cache or scan. New filters/options:

- `--supersedes <id>`: ADRs whose `supersedes` includes `<id>`.
- `--status` accepts MADR vocabulary. Wildcards: `--status "superseded by *"` matches any supersession.
- `--format ids`: one ID per line on stdout, no decoration.

### `adg view --id <id> [--section <name>]`

Renders ADR body to stdout. With `--section <name>`, prints just that section (canonical MADR names; case-insensitive).

**Round-trip integration:** `adg view --id X | adg edit --from-stdin --id X` is a no-op (modulo date touch).

### `adg validate --model <m> [--quiet]`

Per-decision report. Checks:

1. **Filename** matches `^[0-9]{4}-[a-z0-9-]+\.md$`.
2. **H1** present, non-empty.
3. **Required H2 sections** present: Context and Problem Statement, Considered Options, Decision Outcome.
4. **Considered Options** has at least one bullet.
5. **Decision Outcome** (skipped when `legacy-outcome: true`): if `status == accepted`, must contain `Chosen option:` and the quoted option text must match a bullet in Considered Options.
6. **Status** is exactly one of: `proposed`/`rejected`/`accepted`/`deprecated`, or matches `^superseded by ADR-[0-9]{4}$`.
7. **Supersession integrity (forward):** if status is `superseded by ADR-X`, then ADR-X must exist AND have `<self>` in its `supersedes` list.
8. **Supersession integrity (reverse):** every `supersedes: ["X"]` entry must point to an existing ADR-X whose status is `superseded by ADR-<self>`.
9. **Frontmatter** parseable YAML; known fields have expected types; unknown fields allowed.
10. **Comments integrity:** for each frontmatter `comments` entry, `text` is non-empty and not solely numeric (defends against §A.1 regression).

`--quiet`: suppress per-decision OK lines; print failures only. Exit non-zero iff at least one decision fails.

### `adg rebuild --model <m>`

Rescans files, regenerates `index.yaml` from frontmatter. Idempotent.

### `adg import`, `adg merge`, `adg copy`

Semantics preserved; format adapted (no `AD` prefix, no anchor rewriting). ID renumbering on import touches `supersedes` lists and status strings (`superseded by ADR-NNNN` references adjusted to the new IDs in the target model).

### `adg set-config` / `adg reset-config`

Pruned. Removed: all section-header customization options. Kept: genuinely user-preference settings (default model path, default author). Final list determined in implementation plan.

### `adg migrate --model <m>` — see next section

## Migration (`adg migrate`)

Required step on first use of the fork against a pre-existing model.

### CLI surface

```
adg migrate --model <m> [--dry-run] [--keep-legacy-files] [--drop-comment-pattern <regex>] [--placeholder-template <str>]
```

- `--dry-run`: print would-be changes per file, no writes.
- `--keep-legacy-files`: write `0001-slug.md` alongside `AD0001-slug.md` instead of renaming.
- `--drop-comment-pattern <regex>`: drop comments whose recovered text matches. Repeatable. Practical use: `--drop-comment-pattern '^marked decision as decided$'`.
- `--placeholder-template <str>`: override default placeholder for unrecoverable comment text. Supports `{author}`/`{date}` substitutions.

**Idempotent.** Running twice produces same output as once. Already-migrated files are skipped silently.

### Per-file conversion steps

For each `AD\d{4}-.*\.md`:

1. Parse legacy file (frontmatter, body with anchors, filename ID).
2. **Recover comment text** from body anchors via pattern `<a name="comment-N"></a>\s*N\.\s*\(([^)]+)\)\s+([^:]+):\s*(.*)`. Match against `index.yaml` `comments[N-1]` by position. Missing/unparseable anchors → synthesize placeholder `[text lost to legacy comment-rewrite bug; original posted {date} by {author}]`.
3. Apply `--drop-comment-pattern` regexes to recovered text. Remove matches.
4. **Rewrite frontmatter:**
   - Drop `adr_id`.
   - Drop `links.precedes`, `links.succeeds`.
   - Migrate `links.custom` → top-level `links: {<tag>: [<id>, ...]}` (excluding supersession tags — see step 6).
   - Translate `status: open` → `proposed`, `status: decided` → `accepted`.
   - Add `date: <today>` if absent.
5. **Rewrite body:**
   - Strip all HTML anchors.
   - `## Question` → `## Context and Problem Statement`.
   - `## Options` numbered list → `## Considered Options` asterisk bullets. Option text preserved verbatim.
   - `## Criteria` → `## Decision Drivers`.
   - `## Outcome` → `## Decision Outcome`. Body preserved (per `legacy-outcome` flag).
   - `## Comments` body section regenerated from frontmatter.
   - Unknown H2 sections preserved verbatim.
   - `[option-N](#option-N)` markdown links in outcome rewritten to literal option text.
6. **Supersession links collapse into status:**
   - `links.custom.superseded-by: ["NNNN"]` → `status: "superseded by ADR-NNNN"`.
   - `links.custom.supersedes: ["NNNN"]` → top-level `supersedes: ["NNNN"]`.
   - If both `status: decided` and `superseded-by` present, supersession status wins.
7. **Set `legacy-outcome: true`** for any ADR whose post-migration status is `accepted` or `superseded by *`. Validate will skip the `Chosen option:` shape check on these; the flag is removable by the user (manually or via `adg decide --force`).
8. **Rename file:** `AD0042-slug.md` → `0042-slug.md` via `os.Rename` (git detects the rename at diff time, preserving blame).
9. Rebuild `index.yaml` at end of migration.

### Detection

File needs migration if any of:
- Filename matches `^AD\d{4}-.*\.md$`.
- Body contains `<a name="...">`.
- Frontmatter `status` is `open` or `decided`.
- Frontmatter has `adr_id`.
- Frontmatter `links` has `precedes` or `succeeds`.

If none match, file is MADR-native and skipped.

### Edge cases (called out)

- **Auto-decide comments** (`marked decision as decided`): not filtered by default. User opts in via `--drop-comment-pattern '^marked decision as decided$'`.
- **Prose Decision Outcomes** (free-form paragraphs without `Chosen option:` shape): preserved verbatim, `legacy-outcome: true` set. Validate skips structural check. User can hand-curate later (remove flag) or `adg decide --force` to regenerate.
- **Unrecoverable comment text**: replaced with placeholder string. Author and date recovered from index.yaml stub (only text was wrong).
- **Index/body comment count mismatch**: index is authoritative for the entry list; body anchors are the only text source. Missing anchors → placeholder. Extra anchors → ignored.

### `--dry-run` output

Per-file diff summary on stdout, machine-parseable:

```
0001-use-postgres-for-primary-store.md
  rename: AD0001-use-postgres-for-primary-store.md
  status: decided → accepted
  comments: 1 entry (1 recovered, 0 placeholder, 0 dropped)
  body: 4 sections renamed, 6 anchors stripped, 0 option-N refs rewritten
  legacy-outcome: true
```

End-of-run summary on stderr: `20 files migrated, 0 errors, 6 files had unrecoverable comments (placeholders inserted).`

### Required user workflow (post-PR-4)

```
adg migrate --model docs/decisions --dry-run                                 # preview
adg migrate --model docs/decisions --drop-comment-pattern '^marked .*$'      # actual
git diff                                                                     # review
git add . && git commit -m "Migrate ADRs to MADR 4.0 format"
```

Until this runs, read-side commands refuse with `Error: file <path> appears to use legacy ADG format; run 'adg migrate --model <m>' to convert.`

## Output Split (Stdout/Stderr)

### Convention

- Stdout: machine-parseable values, one per line, in production order.
- Stderr: readable status messages.
- Failure: empty stdout, error on stderr, non-zero exit code.

### Surface

| Command | Stdout | Stderr |
|---|---|---|
| `add` (single) | `0001\n` | `Decision "<title>" (0001) added.` |
| `add` (multi `--title`) | `0001\n0002\n…` (in --title order) | one line per success |
| `revise` | `0050\n` (new ID) | `Decision 0042 revised to 0050.` |
| `list --format=ids` | IDs one per line | (none) |
| `list` (default) | readable list | (none) |
| `view` | rendered body | (none) |
| `view --section <s>` | section content | (none) |
| `migrate --dry-run` | per-file summaries | end-of-run summary |

**No machine value (status to stderr):** `init`, `decide`, `comment`, `edit`, `link`, `supersede`, `tag`, `copy`, `import`, `merge`, `rebuild`, `set-config`, `reset-config`, `validate`.

`validate`'s per-decision OK lines move to stderr. `--quiet` suppresses them entirely.

### Implementation

Direct `os.Stderr` / `os.Stdout` references (no DI of writers — CLI is small enough). Presenter test harness extended to capture both streams separately. Per-command assertions on each.

### Backwards-compat callout

Documented in PR-2 description:
- **Removed:** regex-parsing `(0042)` from `adg add`. Use `id=$(adg add --title …)`.
- **Removed:** capturing success message from stdout. Use `2>&1` or stderr capture.
- **Changed:** `adg validate` OK lines now on stderr.
- **New:** `adg list --format=ids`.

## Test Strategy

### Round-trip property (load-bearing invariant)

```
∀ ADR file f in fixtures:
  parse(f) → re-render → f'
  diff(f, f') == ∅   (modulo date if mutating)
```

Fixtures:
- Four upstream MADR 4.0 templates (full/minimal/bare/bare-minimal).
- The fork's canonical `minimal + Decision Drivers` template.
- `models/clean` post-MADR-rewrite.
- Synthetic: custom H2, H3 under Outcome, no frontmatter, all extensions populated, comments rendered, supersession status.
- User's real-repo 20 ADRs post-migration.

### Per-PR test plan

**PR 1 — MADR file format + repository:**
- Round-trip over all fixtures.
- Body parser unit tests (section variants, ordering, case-insensitive, unknown preserved).
- Frontmatter parser unit tests (MADR-only, ADG extensions, unknown fields).
- Renderer unit tests (template emission, comments section, supersession status).
- `models/clean` rewritten in MADR; validates clean; round-trips.

**PR 2 — Command port + stdout/stderr split:**
- Ported behavior tests per command.
- New semantic tests: `decide --force` no longer auto-creates option; status vocabulary; `link` refuses supersession tags.
- Stream-split tests: stdout and stderr captured separately. `add` asserts ID-per-line in `--title` order. `validate --quiet` asserts silent on pass.
- `adg supersede` integration test: atomic two-direction write; refuses pre-superseded ADR; rationale-as-comment.

**PR 3 — `adg edit --from-stdin/--from-file`:**
- Parser tests per section variant.
- Status-gate tests across statuses, with/without `--force`.
- Section-gate tests: Outcome/Comments in input rejected.
- Round-trip integration: `adg view --id X | adg edit --from-stdin --id X` is a no-op.
- Replace semantics: per-section replacement, others untouched.
- Backwards-compat: append form still works on open ADRs; flag form now status-gated.

**PR 4 — `adg migrate`:**
- Per-edge-case fixture tests.
- Idempotence: run twice; second run is no-op.
- User's 20-ADR fixture: post-migration validate passes; all comments non-empty (or placeholder); supersession bidirectional; no `AD` filenames.
- `--dry-run`: no writes; stdout diff matches expected.
- `--drop-comment-pattern`: matching comments dropped.
- `--keep-legacy-files`: originals survive.

### CI

GitHub Actions: `go test ./...`, integration check `adg validate --model models/clean` exits zero. Round-trip tests in unit phase.

## Rollout

### PR sequencing

Originally framed as four PRs (1-4); PR 1 turned out to be too large to plan or review as a single unit, so it is split into four sequential sub-PRs (1a-d) that each leave the build clean:

1. **PR 1a — `feat: MADR parser, renderer, types (additive subpackage)`** — new `internal/domain/decision/madr/` subpackage containing the MADR-shaped types, body and frontmatter parser, renderer, fixture set, and round-trip property test. Purely additive; old anchor-based code untouched; build remains green.
2. **PR 1b — `feat: switch repository to MADR types; drop index.yaml`** — `FileDecisionRepository` rewritten on top of the `madr` package. Old `Decision`/`Links`/`DecisionContent` types deleted from the `decision` package. Service and validator updated minimally to compile.
3. **PR 1c — `refactor: port adapters, interactors, cmd wiring to MADR types`** — mechanical type-only updates across `internal/application/`, `internal/adapter/`, and `cmd/`. Anchor utilities deleted. Build + tests green end-to-end.
4. **PR 1d — `docs: rewrite models/clean in MADR; update README; smoke test`** — example model rewritten as MADR, README updated to point at MADR + spec, end-to-end smoke test added.
5. **PR 2 — `feat: port commands to MADR data model + stdout/stderr split`** — every command ported. §B.3 applied uniformly. `set-config` header flags removed.
6. **PR 3 — `feat: adg edit --from-stdin / --from-file with replace semantics`** — §B.4 with status gating.
7. **PR 4 — `feat: adg migrate from legacy ADG format`** — one-shot conversion with all edge cases.

### User's migration path (post-PR-4)

```
cd ~/your-decision-repo
adg migrate --model docs/decisions --dry-run
adg migrate --model docs/decisions --drop-comment-pattern '^marked decision as decided$'
git diff
git add . && git commit -m "Migrate ADRs to MADR 4.0 format"

### Versioning

Fork starts at `v2.0.0`. Major bump signals file format break.

## Open Questions (to ratify before PR 1)

1. **`index.yaml`** — keep as cache or drop entirely? Recommendation: drop; add as `--cache` opt-in if perf becomes an issue.
2. **`adg revise` and supersession** — should `revise` auto-set up supersession, or stay independent of `adg supersede`? Recommendation: stay independent. User runs `adg revise` then `adg supersede` separately.

## Out of Scope (Deferred)

From the original §C-§D items in the user's pre-design writeup, these are not in this spec:

- §C.5 `adg supersede` — **folded in** (now in scope).
- §C.6 `adg validate --quiet` — **folded in**.
- §C.7 auto-detect model directory / `.adgrc` — deferred. Can be added later as a thin enhancement.
- §C.8 `adg list --format ids` — **folded in**.
- §C.9 `adg edit --replace-option N` / `--remove-option N` — deferred. Achievable today via `--from-stdin` replace.
- §C.10 `adg decide --option <name>` — **folded in** (always supported, both numeric and text).
- §D.11 Full index-as-source-of-truth migration — **superseded** by the MADR refactor itself, which moves frontmatter to source-of-truth status for everything ADG tracks.
