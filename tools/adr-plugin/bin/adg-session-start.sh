# the governance exists even before any lean record does (the whole-corpus brief is empty
# until records carry applies_to, and a read-only/exploring session meets no other hook):
#   1. Greet — when this repo has an ADR model (docs/decisions/), announce that the
#      write-adr governance is active and where its entry points are.
#   2. Version check — if the system `adg` is missing or older than this plugin ships for,
#      surface the install one-liner.
# Plain stdout is added to the agent's context. When the *user* has to act (install or
# update adg) the output switches to the JSON envelope so the advice also reaches them
# directly as a systemMessage — the bundled hooks fail loudly without adg (deliberate:
# governance must not degrade silently), and this message turns that noise into
# instructions. Fail-open: any error prints nothing.
